# Connecting envs for RL to UE4 using UnrealCV and LSD for MAVs using Reinforcement Learning

***ReaL LSD*** is a module that allows MAVs to implicitly perform Landing Site Detection (LSD) and land in the designated spot. This was done with Reinforcement Learning to learn suitable policies to perform the specified task.

# Dependencies
***CUDA*** = 9.0
